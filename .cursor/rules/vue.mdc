## Scripts

Always follow a structure:
- first any use, refs and all the other state-related variables
- then all the hooks like onMounted
- all the functions should be defined as normal ones (not arrow functions) and put at the end of the script to utilize hoisting

## Styles

Use BEM principles, but avoid too much nesting. Use a single characher separator for classes (ie _ not __).
Use camel case class naming.
